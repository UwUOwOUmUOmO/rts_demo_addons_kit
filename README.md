# Addons kit for my unnamed RTS tech demo

This is the addons submodules that is used for [this tech demo of mine](https://github.com/UwUOwOUmUOmO/rts_demo). This is also the same submodule that I used for some other private projects, that's why it seems at first glance that there are unused classes in the demo.

To read a short summary regarding what this submodule does, head over to [the tech demo itself](https://github.com/UwUOwOUmUOmO/rts_demo) and read the markdown file.
